Swift is a multi-paradigm programming language which supports Object Oriented Programming paradigm

# Swift Inheritance

Before talking swift Inheritance let's talk about inheritance first

Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts of Object Oriented Programming(OOP)

As the name suggest inheritance is about inheriting properties (in this case, not the wealth or money).
In OOP sense, inheritance is about inheriting class properties and methods.

A class can inherit methods, properties, and other characteristics from another class. Inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class and reuse the existing code and functionality

### Base Class

The class whose members are inherited to create another class is known as a base class. Base class is also known as parent class or super class.

### Derived class

The new class which is created through inheritance from another class is known as Derived class. Derived class is also known as child class or sub class.

But the terms you will hear frequently together (as a pair) is:

- Base Class - Derived Class
- Parent Class - Child Class
