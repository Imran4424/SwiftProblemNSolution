Swift is a multi-paradigm programming language which supports Object Oriented Programming paradigm

# Swift Inheritance

Before talking swift Inheritance let's talk about inheritance first

Inheritance is a basic feature of Object Oriented Programming(OOP)

As the name suggest inheritance is about inheriting properties (in this case, not the wealth or money).
In OOP sense, inheritance is about inheriting class properties and methods.

A class can inherit methods, properties, and other characteristics from another class

### Base Class

Any class that doesnâ€™t inherit from another class is known as a base class.
