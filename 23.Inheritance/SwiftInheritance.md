Swift is a multi-paradigm programming language which supports Object Oriented Programming paradigm

# Swift Inheritance

Before talking swift Inheritance let's talk about inheritance first

Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts of Object Oriented Programming(OOP)

As the name suggest inheritance is about inheriting properties (in this case, not the wealth or money).
In OOP sense, inheritance is about inheriting class properties and methods.

A class can inherit methods, properties, and other characteristics from another class. Inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class and reuse the existing code and functionality

### Base Class

The class whose members are inherited to create another class is known as a base class. Base class is also known as parent class or super class.

### Derived class

The new class which is created through inheritance from another class is known as Derived class. Derived class is also known as child class or sub class.

The terms you will hear frequently together (as a pair) is:

- Base Class - Derived Class
- Parent Class - Child Class
- Super Class - Sub Class

But there are some exceptions like in swift, the commonly used pair term is: **Base Class - Sub Class**. Which is no big deal since basically means the same thing.

## Types of Inheritance

Depending on the inheritance mechanism, at the core inheritance is two types:

- Single Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance

### Single Inheritance

In single inheritance a class (derived or child class) inherits properties and behaviors from only one other class (the base or parent class).

In simple words, when a dervied class have single base class it is called single inheritance.

### Multiple Inheritance

In multiple inheritance a class (derived or child class) inherits properties and behaviors from multiple (more than one) other class (the base or parent class).

In simple words, when a dervied class have multiple base class it is called single inheritance.

C++ supports both single and multiple inheritance, based on that C++ supports following inheritance

- Single Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance
- Multilevel Inheritance
- Hierarchical Inheritance
- Hybrid Inheritance

### Single Inheritance

When a derived class in only allowed to have only one base class then it is called single inheritance.

### Multiple Inheritance

When a derived class in only allowed to has more than one base class then it is called multiple inheritance.
