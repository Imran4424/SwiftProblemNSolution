/// - We use the `contains(where:)` higher-order function on `String`, which iterates over
///   each `Character` in the string until the closure returns `true`.
/// - The closure receives each `letter` (of type `Character`) and returns a `Bool`.
///   If any letter satisfies the closureâ€™s condition, `contains(where:)` returns `true`,
///   otherwise it returns `false`.
///
/// - Parameter letter: A single `Character` from the `letters` string during iteration.
/// - Return Value: `true` if `letter.uppercased()` is equal to `"E"`, else `false`.

/// - We pass two arguments to `print(_:_)`:
///   1. A human-readable prompt string.
///   2. The `result` boolean from `contains(where:)`.
/// - If `result` is `true`, it means at least one character in `letters` (ignoring case)
///   matches "E". If `false`, no such character was found.
