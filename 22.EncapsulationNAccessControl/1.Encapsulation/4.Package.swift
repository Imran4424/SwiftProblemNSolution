// Swiftâ€™s access control model is based on the concept of modules, source files, and packages.

// A package is a group of modules that you develop as a unit.

// in a package module count can vary from one or more than one


// In swift, what we have learned so far source file, module and packages

// 1. Source file - contains multiple statements
// the enclosed statement is the lowest level encapsulation
// starting with
// computed property
// function
// struct
// enum
// class

// and a single source file can contain definitions for multiple types, functions, and so on.
// which also behaves as encapsulation in terms of modules

// 2. Module
// A module is consist of multiple source files
//
// a module behaves as encapsulation in terms of Packages

// 3. Package
// A package is consist of multiple modules
