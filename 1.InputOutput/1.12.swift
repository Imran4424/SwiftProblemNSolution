// 1.12. Define a variable that can hold either a value or nil. Print the value of the variable

/* 
        Swift Language has six fundamentals Data types

                1. Int
                2. Float
                3. Double
                4. Character
                5. Bool
                6. String

        But there is another data type, but this not exacty data type more like a wrapper of all fundamental 
        or user defined data type

        This wrapper data type is called Optionals

        Optionals are special type of data types which may contain a value or not (value absent or null)
*/

/*  
        We can simply declare a data type as optional by simply appending either of these symbols (? or !)

        ? - If we declare optionals using this symbol, that means this optional can have either a value or nil
        ! - If we declare optionals using this symbol, that means even if this optional primarily have nil 
            but it is guaranteed that in future it will have a value
