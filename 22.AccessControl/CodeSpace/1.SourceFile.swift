// Swift’s access control model is based on the concept of modules, source files, and packages.

// A source file is a single Swift source code file within a module (in effect, a single file within an app or framework). 
// Although it’s common to define individual types in separate source files, a single source file can contain 
// definitions for multiple types, functions, and so on.
